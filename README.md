CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Welcome to my Responsive Portfolio site. Here you will find information about me and my projects. This site was built with CSS and Bootstrap


## Site Structure

The site is simple right now consisting of an About Me page and a Portfolio and Contact page. I hope to add more to it in the future.

As my second assignment in the Columbia Univeristy Engineering Coding Bootcamp, I was given strict instructions on how to update the original portfolio site.
